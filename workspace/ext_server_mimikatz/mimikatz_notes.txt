Modifying Mimikatz Source to Meterpreter Extension
--------------------------------------------

Import all mimikatz/ files.

Set project encoding to Unicode.

Add common.h and reflectivedlll imports within extern "C" {}.

Small modification required to reflectivedll to rename hash (because of std:: namespace)
Small modification to common.h to use OutputDebugStringA due to unicode compilation

Rename some of the mimikatz structures within mod_ntddk.h like PEB due to clashes with RDLL. This also requires rename in mod_process.cpp.

Modification of the getLogonData and genericCredsToStream to strip extra data

Modification of wcout across files to output to our stream buffer.

DLLMain needs removing from kmodel.cpp
